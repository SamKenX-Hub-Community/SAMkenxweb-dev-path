# Web Developer Path

The **Web Dev Path** project is an attempt to offer mentoring on how to work with a version-controlled project in a team environment.

Currently, we're developing [a platform](https://webdevpath.co/) in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The platform will be a place where to share ideas about web development and where Non-Profit Organizations can get some help for their websites by sharing their project and needs and getting connected to volunteer junior web developers. This is [how](https://github.com/MarianaSouza/web-dev-path/projects/1) things are going on so far.

If you are a junior web developer looking for some guidance and mentoring, we invite you to join us and start coding our platform. You will learn how to code in a team environment by following [issue's](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) instructions and submitting your code to our repository through a [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) while guided throughout the entire process.

If you are an experienced and a patient-lovely developer, a true rockstar who wants to mentor juniors, it will be wonderful to have your help to review those PR's, write detailed issues and guide the developers when necessary.
